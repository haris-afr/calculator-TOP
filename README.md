  This calculator was made for the final project of the Odin Project's foundation course, with some creative liberties taken with regards to the instructions.
</p>
<p>It's based off of a CASIO fx-991ES Plus 2 calculator, but with only the core functionality added, as I couldn't be bothered to add all of the trignometric, logarithmic, fraction, etc. features. Also so that I dont get sued by CASIO. Originally it was supposed to have keyboard input, but due to bugs I wasn't able to add it in.</p>
<p>Note: only the keys in the bottom rows work, none of the keys in the top most row have any functionality.</p>
